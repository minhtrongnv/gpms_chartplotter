# Getting Started

This guide walks you through the app. You do the work in the browser — the
server downloads and bakes charts for you. It takes a few minutes.

## Step 1: Start the app

The web frontend is built into the binary, so you need no other files. Start the
server:

```sh
chartplotter serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser. You see an empty map and a toolbar.

## Step 2: Add charts

Open the **Chart Library**, pick a source, and choose a region. The server
downloads the cells and bakes them into tiles in the background.

- **NOAA** — official U.S. charts, grouped by Coast Guard district.
- **Inland ENC** — USACE inland waterway charts.
- **User Charts** — import your own S-57 cells or a NOAA ENC zip.

When the bake finishes, the chart appears on the map. Baking is the
memory-intensive step and can use several gigabytes of RAM for a large region; on
a small machine, add one region at a time. See
[Memory and disk](./installation.md#memory-and-disk).

## Step 3: Switch Day, Dusk, and Night

Tap the color-scheme button to cycle **Day → Dusk → Night**. The map restyles at
once, because the engine stores color names and resolves the palette in the
browser. You never rebake to change the lighting mode.

## Step 4: Adjust the display

Open **Settings** to control what the chart shows: the basemap, the level of
detail, depth shading, soundings, contours, and more. These settings apply live —
the viewer reads attributes already baked into the tiles, so there is nothing to
rebake.

## Step 5: Inspect a feature

Tap any feature to open the **pick report**. It lists the feature's attributes —
restrictions, light characteristics, depths, source dates, and any attached text.

## Where to go next

- Put a chart on your own page — see [Widget mode](./widget.md) for the read-only,
  no-server build and how to package and deploy it.
- Learn how a cell becomes tiles in [Architecture](./architecture.md).
- See the exact tile layers and fields in the [Tile Schema](./tile-schema.md).
- Look up the commands in the [CLI Reference](./cli.md) if you want to bake
  archives from a script.
