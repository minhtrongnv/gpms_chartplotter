# Installation

The quickest path is to **download a release**: every tagged release publishes a
self-contained `chartplotter` for **linux and windows** (amd64 + arm64) on the
[releases page](https://github.com/beetlebugorg/chartplotter/releases). Unpack
the archive for your platform and run it — the web frontend and the S-101
catalogue are compiled in, so you supply only the ENC cells. **macOS** is not
shipped as a prebuilt binary (the engine links Apple frameworks Zig can't
cross-compile). To build it yourself on any platform — including macOS — follow
[Build from source](#build-from-source) below. `go install …@latest` does
**not** work — the build statically links a native library and uses a local
`replace` directive.

:::info About the embedded IHO catalogues

The build embeds the **IHO S-101 Portrayal and Feature Catalogues** into the
chart engine. The IHO publishes those catalogues in its own GitHub repositories
with **no declared license**. The build fetches them via git submodules directly
from the IHO's own repositories, and the resulting binaries — both what you build
locally and what the project publishes on the releases page — embed that IHO
material. The project distributes those binaries as an accepted position; see
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](https://github.com/beetlebugorg/chartplotter/blob/main/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

## Requirements

- **Go 1.26 or newer.**
- **Zig 0.16** — builds the native `libtile57` chart engine.
- **git** — clones the repos and the engine's IHO catalogue submodules.

## Build from source

chartplotter is two repos that must sit **side by side**:

- `chartplotter` (Go) — the app: server, CLI, web frontend.
- `tile57` (Zig) — the chart engine, built as the `libtile57` static library.
  It has nested submodules of its own (the IHO catalogues).

The app's `go.mod` points at `../tile57/bindings/go`, and its Makefile builds
`../tile57/zig-out/lib/libtile57.a` on demand — so the engine checkout (or a
symlink to it) must be a **sibling directory named `tile57`**.

```sh
# 1. The engine, with its IHO catalogue submodules.
git clone https://github.com/beetlebugorg/tile57.git
cd tile57
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..

# 2. The app, as a sibling.
git clone https://github.com/beetlebugorg/chartplotter.git
cd chartplotter

# 3. Build: zig-builds libtile57, then a CGO go build.
make build
```

The build writes the binary to `bin/chartplotter`. Check that it works:

```sh
bin/chartplotter version
```

It prints the chartplotter version and the libtile57 engine version. The binary
is self-contained — the web frontend and the S-101 catalogue are compiled in —
so you can copy it to your `PATH` and run it anywhere on the same platform.

If you keep the engine checkout somewhere else, symlink it into place instead:

```sh
ln -s /path/to/your/tile57-checkout ../tile57
```

### Make targets

The [`Makefile`](https://github.com/beetlebugorg/chartplotter/blob/main/Makefile)
is the ground truth for the build — `make build` zig-builds `libtile57` on demand
and links it into the CGO binary, so there is no separate engine-build step. The
targets you'll use most:

| Target | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make build` | Build `bin/chartplotter` (zig-builds `libtile57`, then a CGO `go build`). |
| `make test` | `go test ./...`. |
| `make vet` | `go vet ./...`. |
| `make fmt` | `gofmt -w .`. |
| `make serve` | Build, then serve the web frontend on `:8080` (`HOST`/`PORT`/`ASSETS` overridable). |
| `make xbuild` | Cross-compile release binaries with `zig cc` (linux + windows, amd64/arm64). |

Run `make fmt vet test` before you commit. `make xbuild` deliberately skips
macOS — Go's `crypto/x509` links Apple frameworks Zig can't cross-compile, so a
Mac binary must be built natively on a Mac. See
[`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/beetlebugorg/chartplotter/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)
for the full build contract.

## Memory and disk

Baking tiles is the heavy step. Memory scales with the size and number of cells
you bake at once, and baking many regions in parallel multiplies it. If you run
on a small machine, such as a Raspberry Pi, bake one region at a time.

Once the tiles are built, the cost drops sharply. Serving charts streams
pre-baked tiles from disk, so a running `chartplotter serve` uses only **modest
RAM** — well within a small machine's budget. Plan your memory for the bake, not
for everyday use.

Baked tiles live in your cache directory (`~/.cache/chartplotter`). Size depends
on the area and detail, from a few megabytes for one harbor to gigabytes for a
whole district.
